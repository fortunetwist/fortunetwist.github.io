} // close of function

// plan: first, set up basic concept with only one option for each sentence portion, using alerts and prompts.
// step two: set up a way to give each sentence part more than one option, based on numbers picked by the user.
// step three: convert code to on-page text, rather than alerts and prompts.
// learn to make input and output show up on page, rather than in alert form.

// fortune structure: ("in" + number + "years, you will be" + success value + career option + "in " + health value + "with" + pets value + "and you shall be " + happiness value)
