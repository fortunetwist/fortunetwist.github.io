<title>Fortune Teller With A Twist v5.7.343 update </title>

<script>


function startGame(){

var userName= prompt("Hello, my inquisitive friend. May I ask your name?");
 alert("Alright, " + userName + ", I have gathered that you with to have your fortune told? Let us begin your session!");

// here is the first output function
function alright(){

tempId= document.getElementById("youWant");

tempId.innerHTML="Alright, " + userName + ", I have gathered that you with to have your fortune told? Let us begin your session!";
}// end function:alright



// dear SAF I am so proud of you, signed mr. Rowe
// please examine the output test file , then merge that code in here...



// plan: first, set up basic concept with only one option for each sentence portion, using alerts and prompts.
// step two: set up a way to give each sentence part more than one option, based on numbers picked by the user.
// step three: convert code to on-page text, rather than alerts and prompts.
// learn to make input and output show up on page, rather than in alert form.

// fortune structure: ("in" + number + "years, you will be" + success value + career option + "in " + health value + "with" + pets value + "and you shall be " + happiness value)
